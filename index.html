      <p style = "font-weight: bold;">  Going Forward is a rotational exhibition space and archive housing works of D+M students. 
        <br>
        The exhibition will assemble digital, physical, and in-progress works that will live in the D+M front corridor.
       <br><br>
       In tandem with the corridor exhibition, Going Forward will also feature an archive website that will accumulate over the course of the semester. This navigable website can be accessed through the monitor display in the space.
