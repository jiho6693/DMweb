      <p style = "font-weight: bold;">  Going Forward is a rotational exhibition space and archive housing works of D+M students. 

        The exhibition will assemble digital, physical, and in-progress works that will live in the D+M front corridor.
        
        
        <br><br> 
        In tandem with the corridor exhibition, Going Forward will also feature an archive website that will accumulate over the course of the semester. This navigable website can be accessed through the monitor display in the space. Past and present works of artists will be available on this site, in addition to information on the displayed artists and links to their personal websites.
        
        
        <br><br>
        While the main focus of Going Forward is compiling a digital archive, there is also room for students to present physical and in-process works. Solo shows will be up for a week, and multi-artist shows will be up for two weeks. These timelines are flexible and subject to change to compensate for the needs of the exhibition.  </p>
